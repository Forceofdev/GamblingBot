# Gambling - Universally
Ever felt like gambling on Discord? 
Well, as you might know, Discord has bots. Bots are most often installed within servers (guilds, as Discord likes to call them), but a recent change has introduced user-installable bots. These bots are usable ANYWHERE, no matter if the bot is installed or not. Due to the lack of popularity with these user-installable bots, most servers don't switch off the permission "Use External Apps", and so, you can use these bots to trick people into thinking their server now has a gambling bot, or whatever you might want. 

This bot is written on Discord.js, however due to the lack of availability for user-installable text commands, it utilizes the REST api. The code itself for the bot may be quite messy, but if you're curious on how the gamblingbot works, you can check the code and see for yourself.

DISCLAIMER: This is not actual gambling!!! It's just a funny name I made up for it. There is no real money involved, and any 'currency' shown is simply a number and is NOT equivalent to real life money!!
